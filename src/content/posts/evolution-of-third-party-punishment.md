Our recent paper on the evolution of third-party punishment behavior was published in Proceedings for The Royal Society B! Here is a [link to the full paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24335985/).

It subsequently attracted considerable media coverage, including a press release at Bloomberg News: [Why Some Communities Police Themselves, While Others Don't](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-16/why-some-communities-police-themselves-while-others-don-t), Science Daily: [Evolution of 'third party punishment'](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131210193136.htm), and the Maryland Institute for Systems Research: [Crime and punishment: interdisciplinary researchers explain ‘third party’ evolution](https://isr.umd.edu/news/story/crime-and-punishment-interdisciplinary-researchers-explain-third-party-evolution).

To excerpt from the latter:

> Game theory has been used before in social science work, but this is the first time that cross-cultural psychologists and computational game theorists have collaborated to examine the evolution of third-party punishment.
